I am a **software engineer** living in Japan working in the game industry. 

Currently, I am mainly focused on **game engine architecture** and topics related to game production. 
In particular, **I am interested in how data flow** from the artist producing game content to the image displayed on the player's screen.

I expect this blog will help me clarify my thoughts and **I hope it will create opportunities to exchange** with people sharing similar interests.

For any questions, comments, or feedback reach me via email or social networks.
